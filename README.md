## Marketing Campaign Planner

## Introduction
Marketing Campaign Planner is a central tool designed for marketers, media managers, and insights teams to plan, measure, and optimize marketing strategies. With an integrated dashboard, a repository of historical campaigns, and future campaign predictions using machine learning models, this tool aims to streamline marketing efforts for small to medium-sized businesses.

## Features
- **Dashboard**: Visualize key performance metrics for ongoing programs and overall marketing calendar.
- **Historical Data Repository**: Access past campaign data to inform future marketing strategies.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Employ machine learning models trained on historical data to forecast sales and ROI.
- **Media Optimization**: Leverage insights from ML models to fine-tune media and channel plans.
- **AI-Generated Insights**: Utilize OpenAI's API for informed recommendations on campaign performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI, React Charts
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Scikit-learn, OpenAI

## Focus
The application is an evenly focused full-stack project:
- The **frontend** is designed for an intuitive user experience, showcasing data and insights in a meaningful way.
- The **backend** serves as the workhorse, integrating with machine learning models and APIs to generate valuable analytics.

## Platform
This project is a single-page web application, optimized for desktop use in a B2B environment.

## Goals
- Structuring a React-based frontend application.
- Implementing machine learning models for sales prediction.
- Integrating OpenAI's RAG for enhanced data-driven insights.

## Users
The primary users of this application are businesses, specifically their marketing departments, looking to enhance their marketing planning through data analytics and AI.

## Data Handling
The app utilizes a simulated dataset reflecting a company's historical marketing activities and sales data. This dataset forms the backbone of the predictive and analytical features of the app.

## Approach
- **Database Schema**: The schema will be structured to reflect campaign details, sales data, and user information.
- **API Challenges**: Ensuring the quality and actionable nature of insights from OpenAI's API, alongside maintaining data integrity and security.
- **Security**: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive company data.

## User Flow
1. Users log in and are greeted by the dashboard.
2. Users can navigate to the campaign manager to manage and view detailed campaign data.
3. The main dashboard provides a snapshot of AI-generated insights and ML-driven sales forecasts.

## Beyond CRUD
The application transcends basic CRUD functionality by incorporating AI and ML to provide predictive analytics and actionable insights, setting it apart as an advanced marketing tool.

## Stretch Goals
- Develop an advanced analytics route for power users to interact with the ML model directly.
- Consider transitioning from OpenAI's model to a more advanced model like Llama-2.
